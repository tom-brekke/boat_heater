# boat_heater
a bit of code for a raspberry pi which will monitor the temperature and turn on and off a lamp. Usefull for keeping the temperature at the ideal setting for the epoxy to cure while I was building my boat. 

make sure to use an old-school halogen light buld rather than an LED as the LEDs don't put out any heat.
